# Agile-methodology

## Introduction.

This is a simple manual to have at hand the most important concepts and topics about the Agile methodology implemented to work at IBM.

# General concepts

## Values
The agile manifesto has four important values

## What is Agile?

It is a new way to think based on values, practices and principles that work to carry out any type of project efficiently and professionally.

## Roles in Agile

The Product Owner Oversees all the business conditions of the project to ensure the right product is built and in the right order. 


The Iteration Manager (Scrum Master) Is the team’s coach; they help the team work together effectively. Iteration Managers service the team by removing barriers that impair the progress, facilitating meetings and discussion groups, tracking progress, problem solving, and performing other project management duties.


The team Works together to determine the best approach to achieve the product goals that are outlined by the product owner. The team decides which members will manage specific tasks, and outline the technical practices required to achieve the desired goals.

# Definitions

## Agile Project Charter and MVP

Agile Project Charter. It is considered as the basis on which all the work, rules, tools and behaviors of the team are built.

The Project Charter contains three key elements:

    1. Vision: The vision defines the "why" of the project. This is the superior purpose, or the reason for the existence of the project.

    2. Mission: This is the "What" of the project and establishes what will be done in the project to achieve its superior purpose.

    3. Success criteria: success criteria are management tests that describe the effects outside the solution itself.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

El MVP es la forma más fácil de probar un producto con el menor uso posible de los recursos, antes de ponerlo en el mercado.

## Social Contract

Social contracts are put in place by teams to define the way that a particular team chooses to work. It's an agreement between the team members that enables them to self-organise and be effective

## Daily Standup (Stand-Up Meetings)

The sessions are held daily by the team so they can share pertinent information with each other.

        What did I do yesterday?

        What will I do today?

        What problems are hindering my progress?

## User Stories

A user story is a brief description of the function wanted by the end user. There are three elements to the user story. They are:

        A written description, planning the story (usually written on a card)

        A conversation about the story to gain better understanding

        A series of tests confirming the story.

## Definition of Done

It is a checklist of valuable activities needed to produce software that add verifiable / demonstrable value to the product.

Focusing on the value-added steps allows the team to focus on what needs to be completed to create software and eliminate unnecessary activities that only complicate software development efforts

#### Story Points

Story Points or Story Points are a unit of measure to express or estimate the general effort that would be necessary to make an item of a product or any other part of production. Is a number or metric that indicates to the team how difficult / simple the story is (work to be done) and is directly related to complexity, unknowns and effort.

The assigned values are not important, what matters are the relative values between the different stories.

Examples of scales to assign in Story Points:

    1. 1,2,4,8,16

    2. X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large (known as "T-Shirt Sizing")

    3. Fibonacci sequence: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21

Agile Planning: (Release, Iteration and Task)

There are three levels of Agile development planning: release, iteration, and task. In the beginning stages, project developers and customers meet to discuss the primary user stories that are needed for the software. 
The meeting’s initial focus is on the must-have features to estimate and prioritize what needs to be done.

### Release planning 

Is a customer-driven planning session. Both customers and developers choose a date for the first product release series. 
They collaboratively decide what stories to incorporate during each release. The developers focus on the estimate efforts of the story while the customers focus on the story selections.

### Iteration planning

Requires collaborative efforts between customers and developers to initiate part of the release plan. During iterations, the customer defines and prioritizes the user stories while the developers estimate how much effort is required to develop each user story. 
The timeline is much shorter for iterations, taking only weeks instead of months.

### Task planning 

Occurs after the iteration planning. Stories are broken down into a series of doable steps by the development team. Task lists are developed and posted in the project room so they are clearly visible to all party members. 
Common tools used during this planning session include post-it notes and whiteboards. Each developer volunteers to perform a task and assign an estimate to it.
