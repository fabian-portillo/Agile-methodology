The Product Owner Oversees all the business conditions of the project to ensure the right product is built and in the right order. 


The Iteration Manager (Scrum Master) Is the team’s coach; they help the team work together effectively. Iteration Managers service the team by removing barriers that impair the progress, facilitating meetings and discussion groups, tracking progress, problem solving, and performing other project management duties.


The team Works together to determine the best approach to achieve the product goals that are outlined by the product owner. The team decides which members will manage specific tasks, and outline the technical practices required to achieve the desired goals.

Agile Project Charter and MVP

Agile Project Charter. It is considered as the basis on which all the work, rules, tools and behaviors of the team are built.

The Project Charter contains three key elements:

### 1. Vision: The vision defines the "why" of the project. This is the superior purpose, or the reason for the existence of the project.

### 2. Mission: This is the "What" of the project and establishes what will be done in the project to achieve its superior purpose.

### 3. Success criteria: success criteria are management tests that describe the effects outside the solution itself.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

El MVP es la forma más fácil de probar un producto con el menor uso posible de los recursos, antes de ponerlo en el mercado.

## Social Contract

Social contracts are put in place by teams to define the way that a particular team chooses to work. It's an agreement between the team members that enables them to self-organise and be effective
