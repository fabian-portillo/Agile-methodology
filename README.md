## What is Agile?

It is a new way to think based on values, practices and principles that work to carry out any type of project efficiently and professionally.

## Roles in Agile

The Product Owner Oversees all the business conditions of the project to ensure the right product is built and in the right order. 



The Iteration Manager (Scrum Master) Is the team’s coach; they help the team work together effectively. Iteration Managers service the team by removing barriers that impair the progress, facilitating meetings and discussion groups, tracking progress, problem solving, and performing other project management duties.



The team Works together to determine the best approach to achieve the product goals that are outlined by the product owner. The team decides which members will manage specific tasks, and outline the technical practices required to achieve the desired goals.

## Agile Project Charter and MVP

Agile Project Charter. It is considered as the basis on which all the work, rules, tools and behaviors of the team are built.

The Project Charter contains three key elements:

1. Vision: The vision defines the "why" of the project. This is the superior purpose, or the reason for the existence of the project.

2. Mission: This is the "What" of the project and establishes what will be done in the project to achieve its superior purpose.

3. Success criteria: success criteria are management tests that describe the effects outside the solution itself.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

El MVP es la forma más fácil de probar un producto con el menor uso posible de los recursos, antes de ponerlo en el mercado.

## Social Contract

Social contracts are put in place by teams to define the way that a particular team chooses to work. It's an agreement between the team members that enables them to self-organise and be effective

## Daily Standup (Stand-Up Meetings)

The sessions are held daily by the team so they can share pertinent information with each other.

        What did I do yesterday?

        What will I do today?

        What problems are hindering my progress?

## User Stories

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50177169/59809906-6f4de080-92c8-11e9-8c33-b61628828bc1.png)

A user story is a brief description of the function wanted by the end user. There are three elements to the user story. They are:

        A written description, planning the story (usually written on a card)

        A conversation about the story to gain better understanding

        A series of tests confirming the story.

## Definition of Done

It is a checklist of valuable activities needed to produce software that add verifiable / demonstrable value to the product.

Focusing on the value-added steps allows the team to focus on what needs to be completed to create software and eliminate unnecessary activities that only complicate software development efforts

#### Story Points

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50177169/59809958-a6bc8d00-92c8-11e9-9ccc-1f7ccd8599ef.png)

Story Points or Story Points are a unit of measure to express or estimate the general effort that would be necessary to make an item of a product or any other part of production. Is a number or metric that indicates to the team how difficult / simple the story is (work to be done) and is directly related to complexity, unknowns and effort.

The assigned values are not important, what matters are the relative values between the different stories.

Examples of scales to assign in Story Points:

    1. 1,2,4,8,16

    2. X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large (known as "T-Shirt Sizing")

    3. Fibonacci sequence: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21

Agile Planning: (Release, Iteration and Task)

There are three levels of Agile development planning: release, iteration, and task. In the beginning stages, project developers and customers meet to discuss the primary user stories that are needed for the software. 
The meeting’s initial focus is on the must-have features to estimate and prioritize what needs to be done.

### Release planning 

Is a customer-driven planning session. Both customers and developers choose a date for the first product release series. 
They collaboratively decide what stories to incorporate during each release. The developers focus on the estimate efforts of the story while the customers focus on the story selections.

### Iteration planning

Requires collaborative efforts between customers and developers to initiate part of the release plan. During iterations, the customer defines and prioritizes the user stories while the developers estimate how much effort is required to develop each user story. 
The timeline is much shorter for iterations, taking only weeks instead of months.

### Task planning 

Occurs after the iteration planning. Stories are broken down into a series of doable steps by the development team. Task lists are developed and posted in the project room so they are clearly visible to all party members. 
Common tools used during this planning session include post-it notes and whiteboards. Each developer volunteers to perform a task and assign an estimate to it.

## Portfolio Wall

A Portfolio Wall provides transparency of the flow of projects of an organization. When the flow of work is made visible, anyone can see, at a glance, an organization's projects and high level status.
Participants

• Iteration Manager

• Cross-functional Team

• Project Manager

## Iteration Wall

The Iteration wall is used by Agile Teams to track the work through one iteration. 
There are other common work walls: the Portfolio Wall, which allows upper management to track projects or epics of many teams across a large organization, and the Release, Program or Project Wall, which allows project managers to plan and track an entire project or release by visualizing epics and features through several iterations.

#### Participants

• Iteration Manager

• Cross-functional Team

## Release Wall
The Release, Program or Project Wall allows project managers to plan and track an entire project or release by visualizing epics and features through several iterations. 

A Release wall is not meant to be a commitment, but a planning and communication tool for the organization. Release walls are generally used to help see dependencies across teams and visualize the flow of work across several iterations.

#### Participants

• Product Owner

• Offering Manager

• Iteration Manager

• Deployment Manager

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives are meeting held at or near the end of a project. They give all parties involved a chance to look back and reflect on the work done during the process. 

The entire team looks at what went well, what did not, where improvements can be made and, most importantly, how they can take the lessons that they have learned and turn them into actionable change.

## Showcases
The Showcase is a chance for the team to get feedback from stakeholders on the completed work and to discuss and adapt the backlog and prioritization. All who have an interest in the product, especially key stakeholders, are encouraged to attend this meeting.

Much more than a demo, this is a chance for the Product Owner and team to listen and learn from the feedback from the stakeholders and to make adjustments to next steps based on this new information. This is often called "inspect and adapt."

  #### Recommended: 30 minutes. 
  
## Product Backlog

Is simply a list of all things that needs to be done within the project. It replaces the traditional requirements specification artifacts. These items can have a technical nature or can be user-centric e.g. in the form of user stories.

## Burndown Chart

A Burn-Up chart is a way of visualizing the rate of progress of a team. It shows the amount of work completed and remaining during a time-boxed period of work such as an Iteration or Release.

#### Participants
• Cross-functional Team

• Iteration Manager

## Velocity

#### Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can tackle during a single Sprint and is the key metric in Agile. 
#### Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed.

# Agile Software Development Cycle

## Automated Testing
Implementing formal and thorough automated testing is a vital part of the agile process. The tests find and eliminate defects at their source to ensure that a working software package is delivered to the customer. 

Developers can create the test code under a safety net using a variety of available frameworks while simultaneously developing the software code. This method protects other features while making changes to the software. It is also a faster, more efficient way to find bugs in the program.

## Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development is a core agile and DevOps practice which is a complement to development methods where test cases are key to the development process. Unit and Component level test cases are developed in an automation framework such as Junit before any code is written. 

The code that is written is always developed in response to a failing test. These test cases become part of your automated test suite which can be executed as part of your continuous integration process.

## Pair Programming

In pair programming, two developers work as a team on one programming task. 
One person is the Driver, the person who enters the code, while the second person is the Navigator, the one who plans the next steps while fitting the code into the whole picture.

## Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery

During continuous integration, development teams input their code into the system several times throughout the day. A series of tests are run before the code is added to make sure it won’t damage other pre-existing tests or functions in the system.
